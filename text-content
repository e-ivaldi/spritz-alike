Rapid serial visual presentation is an experimental model frequently used to examine the temporal characteristics of attention. The RSVP paradigm entails participants to look at a continuous presentation of visual items which is around 10 items per second. They are all shown in the same place. The targets are implanted inside this stream of continuous items. They are separate from the rest of the items and can be called distracters. The distracters can either be a color change or it can be letters that are among the numbers.
